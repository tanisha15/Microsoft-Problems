Given an array of distinct elements. Find the third largest element in it.

Suppose you have A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, its output will be 5 because it is the 3 largest element in the array A.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {2,4,1,3,5}
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
A[] = {10,2}
Output: -1
Your Task:
Complete the function thirdLargest() which takes the array a[] and the size of the array, n, as input parameters and returns the third largest element in the array. It return -1 if there are less than 3 elements in the given array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105

Concept:

To solve the problem of finding the third largest element in an array of distinct elements, we can follow these steps:

Check the Array Length: If the array has fewer than three elements, return -1 as it's not possible to find the third largest element.
Initialize Three Variables: Maintain three variables to keep track of the first, second, and third largest elements.
Traverse the Array: Iterate through the array and update the three variables accordingly.
If the current element is greater than the first largest, update all three (shift first to second, second to third, and the current element to first).
Else if the current element is greater than the second largest, update the second and third largest.
Else if the current element is greater than the third largest, update the third largest.


class Solution
{
    int thirdLargest(int a[], int n)
    {
	    // Your code here
	    if(a.length<3){
	        return -1;
	    }
	        int first=0;
	        int second=0;
	        int third=0;
	        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	            if(a[i]>first){
	                third=second;
	                second=first;
	                first=a[i];
	            }
	            else if(a[i]>second){
	                third=second;
	                second=a[i];
	            }
	            else if(a[i]>third){
	                third=a[i];
	            }
	        }
	    return third;
    }
}
